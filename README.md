import boto3
import random
import string

# Import necessary libraries: `boto3` is the AWS SDK for Python, `random` and `string` are used to generate random passwords, and `json` is used to work with JSON data.

def create_iam_user(user_name):
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# This function is defined to create an IAM user in AWS (Identity and Access Management). `boto3.client('iam')` creates a client object to interact with the IAM service.

def add_user_to_group(user_name, group_name):
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# This function is defined to add a user to an IAM group. It also creates an IAM client object.

def create_iam_group(group_name):
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# This function is defined to create an IAM group in AWS. It also creates an IAM client object.

def add_permissions(user_name, services, region):
    iam_client = boto3.client('iam')

# This function is defined to add permissions (IAM policies) to an IAM user based on the services and region provided. It also creates an IAM client object.

def generate_random_password(length=8):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

# This function generates a random password of the specified length (default is 8 characters) using alphanumeric characters and punctuation symbols.

# The 'main' function is called when the script is executed. It initiates the process of creating IAM users, granting them permissions, generating temporary passwords, and adding them to the 'herovired' group. Finally, it prints the necessary information for each user.
